Import structures have been changed. Now, you can import the social icons from `@blend-metrics/social` as well as `@blend-metrics/social-solid`. Likewise, the integration icons, country icons, peyment method icons, and other icons can be imported in the following order `@blend-metrics/brands`, `@blend-metrics/flags`,` @blend-metrics/payment-methods`, and `@blend-metrics/icons`
